Progr3ss Android (frontend)

This folder contains the Android frontend scaffold for the Progr3ss project.

Quickstart
1. Open this folder in Android Studio (Open an existing Android Studio project).
2. Let Android Studio sync Gradle and download dependencies.
3. Run the `app` module on an emulator or device.

This is a minimal starter scaffold (AppCompat + simple Activity). We'll switch to Jetpack Compose or another architecture later per the project specification.
